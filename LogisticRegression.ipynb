For this exercise, use Scikit-Learn in Python. Download the dataset of the HW02 from piazza. The dataset is in Matlab format (.mat); you can use\n","scipy.io.savemat to convert it to python format (.npy). There are 126 training and 14 test samples,\n","each being a two-dimensional feature vector. There are two classes (0 and 1).\n","\n","1.   Write down a code in Python (that uses logistic regression in Scikit-Learn) whose inputs are a\n","training dataset and a test dataset and its output is the classification error on the test set. \n","2.   Report the classification error on the test set of the dataset used in the previous question. \n","3.   Plot the data (use different colors for data in different classes) \n","4.   Plot the decision boundary found by the logistic\n","regressions.\n","5.   Report the train and test classification accuracies (percentage of samples in the training/testing set that get classified correctly using the learned logistic regression model)."],"metadata":{"id":"BhQSfGL-z_TD"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":21,"metadata":{"id":"sOalB29FujIG","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1645622997200,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":745,"user":{"displayName":"ASHWIN UNNIKRISHNAN","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"02249806048167270554"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["import scipy.io\n","from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')\n","%cd /content/drive/MyDrive\n","%cd GitHub/\n","%cd \"Machine Learning 6140\"\n","mat = scipy.io.loadmat('hw02_dataset.mat')\n","mat.keys()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"5aBpa2zgupDU","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1645622414291,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":952,"user":{"displayName":"ASHWIN UNNIKRISHNAN","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"02249806048167270554"}},"outputId":"9e75058d-c6ef-47c7-8bd9-760af18aac2b"},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Drive already mounted at /content/drive; to attempt to forcibly remount, call drive.mount(\"/content/drive\", force_remount=True).\n","/content/drive/MyDrive\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/GitHub\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/GitHub/Machine Learning 6140\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["xTrain = mat['X_trn']\n","xTest = mat['X_tst']\n","yTrain = mat['Y_trn']\n","yTest = mat['Y_tst']"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"ibXIivYtwWcE","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1645623245739,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":134,"user":{"displayName":"ASHWIN UNNIKRISHNAN","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"02249806048167270554"}},"outputId":"878b8ca0-5373-4b05-a371-dd036368abcb"},"execution_count":37,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["14"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":37}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def logRegression(xTrain, yTrain):\n","  logreg = LogisticRegression()\n","  logreg.fit(xTrain,yTrain)\n","  return logreg"],"metadata":{"id":"Mh2yLap0xhVz","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1645623837868,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":140,"user":{"displayName":"ASHWIN UNNIKRISHNAN","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"02249806048167270554"}}},"execution_count":44,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def accuracy(pred, corr, values, strData):\n","  '''\n","    Finding the correct prediction and then dividing it by total count\n","  '''\n","  correct = 0\n","  print(strData)\n","  for i in range(len(pred)):\n","    if pred[i] == corr[i]:\n","      correct += 1\n","    else:\n","      print(\"At point {0} the model predicted {1} instead of predicting it as {2}\".format(values[i], pred[i], corr[i]))\n","  return (float(correct))/len(pred)"],"metadata":{"id":"rdkGWpGi0x7-","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1645624452632,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":144,"user":{"displayName":"ASHWIN UNNIKRISHNAN","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"02249806048167270554"}}},"execution_count":61,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"metadata":{"id":"s2OS10aF3mRz"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["logRegModel = logRegression(xTrain, yTrain.ravel())\n","y_pred=logRegModel.predict(xTest)\n","print(\"Acccuracy of Test Set = {0}\".format(accuracy(y_pred, yTest.ravel(), xTest, \"Test Dataset 14 Test Samples\")))\n","y_pred_training=logRegModel.predict(xTrain)\n","print(\"Acccuracy of Training Set = {0}\".format(accuracy(y_pred_training, yTrain.ravel(), xTrain, \"Training Dataset 126 Samples\")))\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"aO-uGdKnzxRb","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1645624453974,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":149,"user":{"displayName":"ASHWIN UNNIKRISHNAN","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"02249806048167270554"}},"outputId":"4acb89d4-55cb-4038-f40a-304836464a61"},"execution_count":62,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Test Dataset 14 Test Samples\n","At point [0.09501226 1.93607323] the model predicted 0 instead of predicting it as 1\n","Acccuracy of Test Set = 0.9285714285714286\n","Training Dataset 126 Samples\n","At point [-0.25822186  0.93823088] the model predicted 1 instead of predicting it as 0\n","At point [0.4362074  1.11760096] the model predicted 1 instead of predicting it as 0\n","At point [-0.18597093  1.24664816] the model predicted 0 instead of predicting it as 1\n","At point [-0.15020593  2.03579494] the model predicted 0 instead of predicting it as 1\n","Acccuracy of Training Set = 0.9682539682539683\n"]}]}]}
